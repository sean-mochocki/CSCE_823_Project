Automotive securityresearch, for the most part, began in 2010 when researchers from the University of Washington and theUniversity of California San Diego [1] showed that if they could inject messages into the CAN bus of avehicle (believed to be a 2009 Chevy Malibu) they could make physical changes to the car, such ascontrolling the display on the speedometer, killing the engine, as well as affecting braking. This researchwas very interesting but received widespread criticism because people claimed there was not a way foran attacker to inject these types of messages without close physical access to the vehicle, and with thattype of access, they could just cut a cable or perform some other physical attack.

00fb7052-6ede-4082-91be-8d355250b822.json,Key Terrain in Cyberspace: Seeking the High Ground,"In military doctrine, key terrain refers to areas which, if seized, afford an advantageto an attacker or defender. When applied to geographic terrain, this defi nition is clear. Keyterrain might include a hill that overlooks a valley an enemy wants to control or a crossing pointover a river that must be traversed before launching an attack. By defi nition, dominance of keyterrain is likely to decide the overall outcome of a battle. While cyber key terrain is similarto geographic key terrain in some ways, there are also signifi cant and often counterintuitivedifferences. Some consider cyber terrain to be tied to a physical location and to be representedin cyberspace by routers, switches, cables, and other devices. We will argue that key terrainin cyberspace exists at all of the cyberspace planes, which include the geographic, physical,logical, cyber persona, and supervisory planes [1]. In many cases, features of cyber terrain willnot be tied to a specifi c location, or the geographic location will be irrelevant. In this paperwe deconstruct and analyze cyber key terrain, provide a generalized framework for criticalanalysis, and draw parallels between cyber and physical key terrain while providing examplesof key terrain in cyber operations. During a cyber operation, an analysis of key terrain will aid inthe strategy and tactics of both the offense and the defense. During peacetime, an understandingof cyber key terrain can be employed broadly, ranging from helping a system administratorfocus scarce resources to defend his network all the way to allowing nation-state militaries todevelop long-lasting and effective doctrine.",['Cyber Education Hub->Law And Doctrine->Law'],"['cyber operations', 'cyber terrain', 'key terrain', 'terrain analysis']",Web Resource,PDF

Such an attack could be directed against any portion of the communications systemand be of extended duration or else just long enough to lose crypto synchronization.

3d2dccfb-b3e1-4b2b-8c05-956592521e6a.json,Operationalizing Cyber: Recommendations for Future Research,"The United States Air Force has made considerable investments over the last decade to mature and integratecyber operations into daily missions. Traditional computer and network security activities have been transformed into military operations resembling those one might find within air and space domains, to include an operational vocabulary, clear command and control structures, and standardized mission types. However, much research work remains involving the impact of cyber operations on mission assurance, capability defense, incident response as well as education and training. This paper describes some key cyber research areas that may directly benefit or enhance Air Force operations. These include opportunities to improve AirForce cyber weapon systems, improve defensive processes and procedures, integrate with air and space operations, leverage new technologies, visualize and expand cyber situational awareness, and enhance cyber education and training strategies. These key areas were gathered from experts within the Air Force's lead cyber unit and organized by the authors based on direct operation experience. The intent of the paper is to provide the civilian researcher community with a perspective on how cyber operational forces view their craft and environment, as well as provide recommendations on specific areas to focus their research efforts. The cyber operators' perspective is critical when thinking about how to approach these research areas because it allows a broader audience to observe these challenges from more than just the traditional information technology perspective. Where applicable, a brief survey of related work is provided as a potential launching point for future work. A key theme throughout the paper involves how cyber forces should handle complexity and adversity in a large scale, dynamic and contested environment. Complexity in policy, technology integration, defensive posture, incident response, evaluation criteria and workforce development arefundamental topics and require improved strategies, processes and tools to enhance air, space and cyberspace operations.

In the shadow of a poor economic climate, and in an effort toreconstitute our traditional capabilities, the DOD is undergoing sweepingcuts in both funding and manpower. Many programs face deep curtailmentor, in some cases, extinction. As was the case in the 1920s,giving priority to any one mission area could have dire consequencesfor the others.

5ad28d6f-432a-4035-a44c-c44a7247b60b.json,What is IP Spoofing?,"The greatest security vulnerability of the Internet (TCP/IP) architecture is the lack of source address validation, i.e., any sender may put a fake source address in a packet, and the destination-based routing protocols that glue together the global Internet will get that packet to its intended destination.  Attackers exploit this vulnerability by sending many (millions of) spoofed-source-address packets to services on the Internet they wish to disrupt (or take offline altogether). Attackers can further leverage intermediate servers to amplify such packets into even larger packets that will cause greater disruption for the same effort on the attacker's part.  Over the past several months, CAIDA, in collaboration with Matthew Luckie at the University of Waikato, has upgraded Rob Beverly's original spoofing measurement system, developing new client tools for measuring IPv4 and IPv6 spoofing capabilities, along with services that provide reporting and allow users to opt-in or out of sharing the data publicly. To find out if your network provider(s), or any network you are visiting, implements filtering and allow IP spoofing, point your web browser at http://spoofer.caida.org/ and install our simple client.For more technical details about the problem of IP spoofing and our approach to measurement, reporting, notifications and remediation, see the slides from Matthew Luckie's recent http://www.caida.org/publications/pre..., presented to the Australian Network Operators Group (AusNOG) in September 2016.",['Cyber Education Hub->Technology Stacks And Vulnerabilities'],"['ip', 'spoofing']",Web Resource,YouTube

Sadly, while RDP can serve a variety of useful purposes ranging from remote �hands-on� support to configuring and running servers, in the wrong hands it can be a remote control weapon that enables bad actors to zombify your computer and have it do their bidding.How could this happen? If your computer is �listening� for an RDP signal (typically over port TCP 3389), and it is connected to the Internet, it will respond when a remote user asks it if it�s alive. To the remote user, they will be presented with a login screen to your desktop, often without you noticing (especially if your computer is on and you just happen to be away from it). At this point, your computer will prompt them for a password � usually. If you have a poorly configured RDP setup on your computer though, it may just let them in.

However, there exists a disconnectbetween cyber service providers and the operators that rely on their services. In order for the operational communityto better synchronize with the IT community, there must be a way to map a mission�s cyber dependencies anddeconflict them with those systems� cyber defense and system maintenance activities. We analyze the aforementionedproblem and propose a software solution to proactively support mission assurance by mapping a mission down to itscyber assets, identifying system dependencies on resources and its critical infrastructure, and deconflicting missionswith system maintenance schedules. The goal is to enhance collaboration and provide a deconfliction and risk analysismechanism for mission owners and service providers. We created models to analyze how system maintenanceactivities impact a given mission. We present architectural designs and evaluation of the proposed solution. Thesemodels can be further applied to cyber defense or disaster preparedness activities.","['Law', 'Leadership Perspectives']","['cyber key terrain', 'cyber mission assurance', 'cyber security', 'mission assurance', 'mission mapping']",File,PDF

GNSS receivers are used invariety of critical infrastructural services,including communications,power grid distribution, finance,emergency services, ground and airbornenavigation, active sensing, highprecision surveying, and a number ofother critical industries. For example,financial institutions rely on GNSS receiversto provide precise timing forhigh-frequency trading. Wireless networksand cellphone towers useGNSS timing to coordinate signalhandshakes and enable connectivity.Bistatic and multistatic radars as wellas multiple-input�multiple-output (MIMO) system configurations also relyon GPS for transceiver synchronizations. Of course, accurate signal parameterestimation is crucial for position, navigation, and timing (PNT) for GNSSapplications. High level of accuracyis essential for the above operations,implying a necessity to ensure thatthe GNSS data are immune from interferingsources. Interference mitigationand anti-jam techniques mustproceed under the challenging conditionsof weak satellite navigation signalswith highly negative decibelsignal-to-noise-and-interference ratio,and under possible structural similarityof the desired and undesired signals.There are several ways todeliberately compromise positioning,velocity, and timing accuracies. Forexample, spoofers that mimic GNSSsignals can mislead the receivers intofalse positioning, incorrect timing,and wrong velocity.

7a3e3160-cbfc-4ba3-a1dd-20a4d6d3e20d.json,Cryptography: Crash Course Computer Science #33,"oday we�re going to talk about how to keep information secret, and this isn�t a new goal. From as early as Julius Caesar�s Caesar cipher to Mary, Queen of Scots, encrypted messages to kill Queen Elizabeth in 1587, theres has long been a need to encrypt and decrypt private correspondence. This proved especially critical during World War II as Allan Turing and his team at Bletchley Park attempted to decrypt messages from Nazi Enigma machines, and this need has only grown as more and more information sensitive tasks are completed on our computers. So today, we�re going to walk you through some common encryption techniques such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, and RSA which are employed to keep your information safe, private, and secure. Note: In October of 2017, researchers released a viable hack against WPA2, known as KRACK Attack, which uses AES to ensure secure communication between computers and network routers. The problem isn't with AES, which is provably secure, but with the communication protocol between router and computer.  In order to set up secure communication, the computer and router have to agree through what's called a %22handshake%22.  If this handshake is interrupted in just the right way, an attacker can cause the handshake to fault to an insecure state and reveal critical information which makes the connection insecure.  As is often the case with these situations, the problem is with an implementation, not the secure algorithm itself. ",['Cyber Education Hub->Defense And Security Concepts'],[],Web Resource,YouTube

That means breach prevention can�t be the sole cornerstone of an effective cyberstrategy. As outlined in the latest AT&T Cybersecurity Insights report, the question is not if a company is going to be attacked. It�s now a question of when the attack will come.That shouldn�t be an impediment to your business�s future.

We all want to write reliable software, and you can’t have reliable software if it isn’t secure.But as a software engineering professional, you don’t have hours at your disposal to learn about any new discipline that does not appear to offer return on investment, and that’s why we wrote this book: you don’t have to troll through thousands of pages to get to that one nugget that applies to the task at hand; all you need to do is read the chapter or chapters that apply to what you are currently building to help make sure you don’t build it insecurely.When we set out to write this book, what is essentially a massively updated second edition of The 19 Deadly Sins of Software Security, we really didn’t know what to expect. The original book sold well, and most everyone we talked to loved it, mainly because it was short, “to the point,” and very actionable. Every software developer and software designer we have spoken to has said they love the 19 Deadly Sins’ ease of access; there’s no need to learn absolutely everything about software security—you just go to the chapters that apply to the software you are building.

The goal isn't to make people crash: They highlight security holes in order to highlight flaws in car technology, intended to pressure auto manufacturers to be a few steps ahead of their friendly foes. Information security researcher Mathew Solnik gave us a first-hand demonstration on how to wirelessly send commands to the car and remotely tell it what to do. With a little over a grand and about a month of work, Solnik found time outside of his full-time job to reverse-engineer a car's computer system to make it ready for a takeover. From his laptop, he was able to manipulate the car's engine, brakes and security systems by wirelessly tapping into the Controller Area Network, or CAN bus, network. Without getting too deep into the details�both for legal reasons and due to my own training-wheel knowledge of such things�he was able to do so by implementing some off-the-shelf chips, a third party telematic control unit, a GSM-powered wireless transmitter/receiver setup, and a significant amount of know-how he's accrued over the years. The reason for such additional hardware was to make our older, mid-sized sedan function like a newer�and arguably more vulnerable�stock vehicle, which these days often come with data connections. (We would have loved to tinker with the latest, most connected car on the market, but since we were on a shoestring budget and it's incredibly hard to find a friend who's willing to lend their car for a hacking experiment, our pickings were slim.)With that said, a car whose network system is connected to a cloud server and accessible by Bluetooth, cell networks, or wi-fi is potentially vulnerable to intrusion.

But they also create potential opportunities � and incentives � for adversaries to counter U.S. advantages through cyberattacks. For example, a sophisticated adversary may seek to discover and exploit vulnerabilities in an aircraft's software, supporting systems, or supply chain in order to gain intelligence or to sabotage operations. Nor are the potential risks limited to the newest and most advanced systems: Legacy aircraft, which make up the majority of Air Force inventory, are also exposed to attack from evolving cyber threats and must remain vigilant.",['Cyber Education Hub->Technology Stacks And Vulnerabilities'],[],Web Resource,YouTube

The RMF promotes the concept of near real-time risk management and ongoing information system authorization through the implementation of robust continuous monitoring processes, provides senior leaders the necessary information to make cost-effective, risk-based decisions with regard to the organizational information systems supporting their core missions and business functions, and integrates information security into the enterprise architecture and system development life cycle. Applying the RMF within enterprises links risk management processes at the information system level to risk management processes at the organization level through a risk executive (function) and establishes lines of responsibility and accountability for security controls deployed within organizational information systems and inherited by those systems (i.e., common controls).",['Cyber Education Hub->Leadership Perspectives'],"['information systems', 'risk', 'cyber']",Web Resource,PDF

The Internet joins many large computer networks together over ahigh-speed backbone. It transfers information between the computers in the form of packets.Anything that can be digitized can be broken down into packets. Whether the information ise-mail, photos, video, telephone calls, or any other digital data is irrelevant; the packets movejust the same.

The Banshee Innovation Training program is held over 3 days in person at the MassChallenge HQ in Boston, MA (Seaport). Banshees will participate in traditional Banshee training and tackle real world PEO challenges. Following the training, Banshees will have the ability to help select start-ups centered around challenge statements, and the students will participate in the AF Labs program. AF Labs is a 6-week online program, and virtual participation will be expected. However, participation is only estimated to be about 2-3 hours every two weeks. The AF Labs Program culminates in an optional solutions showcase to senior leadership back in Boston during late summer. By merging Banshee with the AF Labs, Banshees will be able to practice what they learned, interact with non-traditional small businesses, and assist those businesses in meeting PEO’s top technology challenges. While each PEO’s Innovation team will be identifying challenge statements, Banshees will have the ability to submit challenge statements as part of their application.

Adversaries can plan their attacks carefully over time by relying on the static nature of our networks, and launch their attacks at the times and places of their choosing. The DoD needs new tools and technologies to reverse the current asymmetry that favors our cyber adversaries, by forcing them to spend more time and resources, cope with greater levels of complexity and uncertainty, and accept greater risks of exposure and detection due to the significantly increased requirements for reconnaissance and intelligence collection of our networks. Throughout history the military has employed deception as a counter-intelligence mechanism, but thus far it has been minimally employed for tactics and strategies in cyberspace to counter cyber exploitation and attack. The best known attempts at cyber deception in the commercial realm are honeypots and honeynets. These passive decoy technologies rely on effective intrusion detection, and if implemented inappropriately, can be easily detected and avoided by attackers.

Security principles such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability � although important, broad, and vague � do not change. Your application will be the more robust the more you apply them.For example, it is a fine thing when implementing data validation to include a centralized validation routine for all form input. However, it is a far finer thing to see validation at each tier for all user input, coupled with appropriate error handling and robust access control.In the last year or so, there has been a significant push to standardize terminology and taxonomy. This version of the Development Guide has normalized its principles with those from major industry texts, while dropping a principle or two present in the first edition of the Development Guide. This is to prevent confusion and to increase compliance with a core set of principles.

88fa8fed-8ec2-484d-8164-d4de3cb8737d.json,Modeling and Simulation Methods for Design of Engineering Syst,"This article presents an overview of the state-of-the art in modeling and simulation, and studies to which extent current simulation technologies can effectively support the design process. For simulation-based design, modeling languages and simulation environments must take into account the special characteristics of the design process.  For instance, languages should allow models to be easily updated and extended to accommodate the various analyses performed throughout the design process. Furthermore, the simulation software should be well integrated with the design tools so that designers and analysts with expertise in different domains can effectively collaborate on the design of complex artifacts. This review focuses in particular on modeling for design of multi-disciplinary engineering systems that combine continuous time and discrete time phenomena.

While the requirement specification activity deals entirely with the problem domain, design is the first phase of transforming the problem into a solution. In the design phase, the customer and business requirements and technical considerations all come together to formulate a product or a system.The design process comprises a set of principles, concepts and practices, which allow a software engineer to model the system or product that is to be built. This model, known as design model, is assessed for quality and reviewed before a code is generated and tests are conducted. The design model provides details about software data structures, architecture, interfaces and components which are required to implement the system. This chapter discusses the design elements that are required to develop a software design model. It also discusses the design patterns and various software design notations used to represent a software design.","['Cyber Education Hub->Technology Stacks And Vulnerabilities', 'Cyber Education Hub->Engineering And Development->DevSecOps']","['design', 'development', 'security', 'software']",Web Resource,Web Page

185c7a3b-57b9-459b-8995-519e80d92e6c.json,"NMap 101: Scanning Networks Using Alternative Packets, Haktip 95","This week on HakTip Shannon is using NMap to find open ports that can be accessed on the network.Welcome to HakTip -- the show where we breakdown concepts, tools and techniques for hackers, gurus and IT ninjas. I'm Shannon Morse and today we're going to go over Discovery Options.You'll notice whenever you use NMap that it only outputs the servers that are currently alive and operating. This is because it sends out something called an ICMP (internet control message protocol) echo request to look for any devices that are currently 'alive'. By doing so, NMap will save time when giving you information, because it's not going to be scanning anything thats offline. NMap will also scan ports 80 and 443 because, if ICMP is being blocked by a firewall or something similar, these two ports are most commonly used for web platforms. So basically, when you're scanning your network, you're only going to get the items that are open. If you want to scan more secure targets, these alternative discovery options might be more useful.First off is Don't Ping which is used with the -PN option. Sometimes you'll run into a target that seems to be offline. NMap will give you an error that says %22Host seems down [...] try -PN%22. -PN will skip that first ping attempt, and go ahead and do a deep scan of the target. You would type nmap -PN 10.73.31.171.Say you want to just scan the network really quick to see which ones are online - you don't need to know about the names or open ports. You can do a Ping Only Scan. To do so, type nmap -sP (for simple ping) then your target. So mine would be nmap -sP 10.73.31.0/24. After the break, we're going to check out a couple of other alternative discovery options. Stay tuned! We're back! So we know how to do a regular scan, and a couple of discovery options. But there is more! Say you want to scan an item that is blocking the regular ICMP ping that NMap uses before it does a whole scan. You can use a TCP SYN ping instead. This will make NMap send out a SYN packet instead of ICMP. It would look like this: nmap -PS 10.73.31.145. It usually sends out the packet via port 80, but you can change this by adding the port to your command, like this: nmap -PS22,80,443 10.73.31.145.Another option if ICMP pings are being blocked would be using TCP ACK packets, which is similar to the last command, and is used for the same reason. Type: nmap -PA 10.73.31.145. This one can also be used on other ports by adding the port numbers directly after the -PA command.See a pattern here? If one request doesn't return some kind of data from the target, you can always substitute it with another discovery option. With these above, we also have -PU for a UDP scan, -PY for an SCTP INIT scan (Stream Control Transmission Protocol), -PE which is used for ICMP (and is implied if no other option is given), -PP for an ICMP timestamp ping (which is useful for firewalled targets), -PM for an ICMP Address Mask Ping, which will occasionally be able to get through a firewall.Each of these additional options uses popular internet protocols to make sure your NMap network scan ends up getting exactly what you expected.What would you like to see next about NMAP? Send me a comment below or email us at tips@hak5.org. If you like NMap, perhaps you'll enjoy our new show, Metasploit Minute with Mubix, airing every Monday at hak5.org.

302bee32-4026-4704-b5e6-dc321d67e8c7.json,C-Based Application Exploits and Countermeasures - Yves Younan,"The C and C++ programming languages have some serious shortcomings from the point of view of security. Certain kinds of bugs in these languages can have disastrous consequences. Stack- or heap-based buffer overruns, double frees, dangling pointers, race conditions and format-string related vulnerabilities are typical examples of bugs that can make a C/C++ application vulnerable to extremely powerful attacks such as code injection.In a code injection attack, an attacker succeeds in running code of his choosing on the target machine. This module will discuss the most important types of vulnerabilities, and will demonstrate, by example, how they can be exploited.Programmers must avoid these vulnerabilities by observing strict coding disciplines to compensate for the freedom offered by the language and execution environment. Recently, improvements to the compiler and run-time environment have aided in mitigating the risk. Desktop operating system vendors have been using these mitigations for a while to make it harder for attackers to exploit these vulnerabilities. However with the growing popularity of mobile apps, these bugs have also gained importance on mobile devices, where these bugs carry over into both the Native Development Kit for Android and Objective C on iPhone. As a result mobile phone vendors have also added several of these mitigations to their operating systems.An overview of these improvements such as address space randomization and stack canaries is presented. The module also looks at how attackers have developed ways around some of these mitigations.The following papers are useful for the module:Y. Younan, W. Joosen and F. Piessens. Code injection in C and C++: A survey of vulnerabilities and CountermeasuresY. Younan, W. Joosen and F. Piessens, Runtime countermeasures for code injection attacks against C and C++ programs�.

Its purpose is toguide force development toward Joint Force 2020, the force called for bythe new defense strategic guidance, Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership:Priorities for 21st Century Defense. A capstone concept by definition articulates a high-order vision ofhow the future force will operate. It cannot by itself provide the detailedguidance necessary to realize the Joint Force of 2020. It can, however,describe the future operating environment, advance new concepts forjoint operations, and suggest attributes that will define the future force.In this way, the CCJO aims to establish a bridge from the new strategicguidance to subordinate concepts, force development guidance, andfollow-on doctrine.This CCJO focuses on what is new and different in the futurestrategic environment. It builds on prior capstone concepts, but alsorecognizes that much of the nature of conflict in the world is enduring.War remains a clash between hostile, independent, and irreconcilablewills each trying to dominate the other through violence. Enemies willcontinue to search for, find, and exploit U.S. vulnerabilities. Even whenwaged with increasingly sophisticated technologies, the conduct ofmilitary operations remains a fundamentally human enterprise.

354faaa8-d5f4-4a76-ba7b-bbebdb1656e8.json,A White-Hat Hacker Demonstrates How to Monitor Traffic on Routers (Livestream Archive),"Today we're going to hack a router with client-side authentication using http traffic inspector (e.g. BURP Suite) and a browser. Many commercially available small-office and home routers perform authentication on the client-browser, which is weak and may be breached easily. This can be easily abused by attackers who can bypass the authentication and then attack the rest of the devices on the router's network. An adversary can reverse engineer the authentication mechanism by going through the source code in the browser. Being able to bypass the authentication on the router will allow an adversary to traverse the rest of the network, manipulate network configurations, and open up other access points including ports to direct traffic in and out of the network. Using BURP lets the user see and edit the requests and responses sent to and from the router's web interface",['Cyber Education Hub->Technology Stacks And Vulnerabilities'],[],Web Resource,YouTube

752f6e82-4884-4cc8-adf2-ef61f05094dc.json,This is How Hackers Crack Passwords!,"In this video, we'll see how hackers really crack passwords. This video is edited with Filmora video editor, get it here : https://goo.gl/RtmNC5DISCLAIMER : This video is intended only to educate people about how hackers crack passwords, and how important the strength of the password is, when coming to security. If you are using a common password like test123456 which I used in the video, then the hacker will easily be able to know the plain text form of your password from the hash string. There is something known as Rainbow tables. These rainbow tables contain the password hashes of numerous commonly used passwords.So the hacker will be to do a simple search with the password hash that he has, and if the password hash exists in the rainbow table, then that means the password is successfully cracked, and we have the password in a plain text. Remember that rainbow tables contain the password hashes of only the passwords which are commonly used. As a reference, you can go to https://crackstation.net/If the password is not a commonly used password, then there comes dictionary attack and brute force attack.In dictionary attack, you have a wordlist. A wordlist is nothing but a  huge text file with loads of passwords. In this attack, the hacker writes a code which compares the password hash to be cracked, with the password hash of each and every password that exists in the wordlist. Now, this attack can be target-specific as well. which means we can build a wordlist targeting an individual provided that we know some basic details about him/her.In a brute force attack, each and every combination of letters ,symbols and numbers are converted into their hash forms, and are then compared with the hash to be cracked. This is a more expensive.A new technique called salting is introduced by security analysts to give hackers a hard time in cracking passwords.In this technique, a specific combination of characters are inserted at specific positions of the plain text password before hashing.Every company has its own salting algorithm, and they don�t make their salting algorithm publicFor example, kets say Facebook salting algorithm inserts the string f&2p at the beginning, after the third character, and at the end of the plain text password.After salting the password, the salted password is then hashed by a hashing algorithm.So when salting is used, rainbow tables are of no use even if the password to be cracked is a weak commonly used password. Because the hashe of the password without salting do not match the hash of the password which is saltedAlso, brute force and dictionary attack are not effective to crack salted passwords unless the hacker already knows the salting algorithm employed by a company.",['Cyber Education Hub->Attack And Exploit Concepts'],[],Web Resource,YouTube

8352e196-7657-446f-8edf-93fa4f0d0702.json,ISP Vulnerabilities Discovered,"  Media Alert:  San Carlos, California, United States  � Check Point� Software Technologies Ltd.  recently released its findings of security concerns in CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP/TR-069) deployments, used by major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) globally to control business and consumer home internet equipment such as Wi-Fi routers, VoIP phones, amongst other devices.   Researchers in Check Point�s Malware and Vulnerability Research Group uncovered a number of critical zero-day vulnerabilities that might have resulted in the compromise of millions of homes and business worldwide, through flaws in several TR-069 server implementations. Once compromised, the malicious exploitation could have led to massive malware infections, illegal mass-surveillance and privacy invasions, and/or service interruptions, including the disabling of an ISP�s Internet service.  Attackers could also steal personal and financial data from huge numbers of businesses and consumers.   Further analysis detected an alarming number of insecure ISPs, vulnerable to remote takeover. Check Point has reported and assisted in fixing all uncovered vulnerabilities.   Key Findings:   �   If undiscovered, an attacker could have taken control of millions of Internet devices across the world, resulting in the ability to steal personal and financial data from businesses and consumers.   �   Many TR-069 deployments include severe security weaknesses. Check Point encourages ISPs and other providers utilizing this protocol to evaluate their security posture immediately.   �   Customers with the Check Point Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Software Blade have automatically received protections against uncovered vulnerabilities.   �Check Point�s mission is to keep one step ahead of malicious attackers. The security flaws uncovered in TR-069 implementations could have resulted in catastrophic attacks against Internet Service Providers and their customers across the world. Our Malware and Vulnerability Research Group continues to focus on uncovering security flaws and developing the necessary real-time protections to secure the Internet,� said Shahar Tal, Vulnerability Research Team Leader at Check Point Software Technologies.

The military remains the biggest target, but our enemies also target academics, high technology, insurance, manufacturing, construction, media, telecommunications, transportation, and even video games.  The largest deterrent to implementing cyber for most businesses is the up-front cost but industry is realizing not having strong cyber resiliency is more costly in the long run.  Additionally, we are shifting focus from simply hardening our systems prior to delivery to a full lifecycle of continual cyber detection and deterrence.  More emphasis is being put on the supply chain as we realize the vulnerabilities that exist with our logistics %22systems%22.

The contractors question the vague language of the requirement, its impact to end cost, schedule and performance.  The government argue that the industrial base cyber security culture must change citing the important and urgency of cyber attacks.   The article highlights the distinctly cyber security issue but also typical problems when the government require contractors to follow new rules or regulations in acquisition.   I believe the contractors' questions are healthy criticism, and it compel the DOD's to maintain critical thinking to keep it fit.   Also,  there is a maxim at the end of the article: Cost, Schedule and Performance mean nothing if the capability delivered has been hacked (CIA) by an adversary.

Attribution has many aspects�technical, political, legal, policy, and soon.

This paper distinguishesbetween attribution of malicious cyber activity to a machine, to a specific human being pressingthe keys that initiate that activity, and to a party that is deemed ultimately responsible for thatactivity. Which type of attribution is relevant depends on the goals of the relevant decisionmaker.Further, attribution is a multidimensional issue that draws on all sources of informationavailable, including technical forensics, human intelligence, signals intelligence, history, andgeopolitics, among others. From the perspective of the victim, some degree of factual uncertaintyattaches to any of these types of attribution, although the last type�attribution to an ultimatelyresponsible party�also implicates to a very large degree legal, policy, and political questions.

A variety of educational institutions, both military and civilian, are grappling with the question, �What should we teach each and every one of our students about cybersecurity?� When these students take their places as leaders and officers in the defense of our country, they need to be aware of this persistent threat.Today�s threatscape is constantly changing, adapting to our countermeasures and continuing to successfully pursue various missions ranging from identity theft, to criminal and nation-based corporate espionage, and, in the case of a worm called Stuxnet, to sabotage. Only a decade ago we had kids attacking systems for the thrill of it; then it was criminals attacking identities. Now it appears to be more about social media, ideology, and insider threats. This book provides great graphics for the threatscape and challenges we are facing today.In May, the Atlantic Wire reported China was winning the cyberwar, in part because they had accessed US physical war plans. Also last week Edward Snowden claimed the United States and Israel co-wrote the Stuxnet worm to damage the Iranian Nuclear program; today, we are still trying to figure out exactly how Stuxnet worked. And while WikiLeaks and Anonymous (the ideology-driven group intent on punishing organizations that did not support WikiLeaks) have been in the news of late, the theft of RSA two-factor authentication intellectual property is especially chilling. If access control fails, everything fails. Identity theft is so commonplace that it is no longer newsworthy. How many people in the United States have had their identity stolen? Many experts say all of them. There is just so much stolen data that the criminals have not yet figured out how to use them all. But they will. Criminal groups are hiring computer scientists to run their cyber-based scams and mine the results. The term cyber warfare is becoming part of discussions on national security. Cybersecurity is an issue that can impact us at the personal level as users of the Internet and at the national defense level as an advanced, persistent threat.","['Cyber Education Hub->Law And Doctrine->Law', 'Cyber Education Hub->Defense And Security Concepts']","['2nd edition', '9780124166721', 'cyber warfare', 'textbook']",Web Resource,Web Page

Command injection attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation.This attack differs from Code Injection, in that code injection allows the attacker to add his own code that is then executed by the application.

CSG is a method that has been implemented in software that quantitatively identifies cyber security risks and uses this metric to determine the optimal employment of security methods for any given investment level. Cyber Security Game maximizes a system�s ability to operate in today�s contested cyber environment by minimizing its mission risk. The risk score is calculated by using a mission impact model to compute the consequences of cyber incidents and combining that with the likelihood that attacks will succeed. The likelihood of attacks succeeding is computed by applying a threat model to a system topology model and defender model. CSG takes into account the widespread interconnectedness of cyber systems, where defenders must defend all multi-step attack paths and an attacker only needs one to succeed. It employs a game theoretic solution using a game formulation that identifies defense strategies to minimize the maximum cyber risk (MiniMax). This webinar discusses the methods and models that compose Cyber Security Game. A limited example of a Point of Sale system is used to provide specific demonstrations of CSG models and analyses.","['Cyber Education Hub->Defense And Security Concepts', 'Cyber Education Hub->Leadership Perspectives']","['cybersecurity', 'engineering', 'game', 'learning', 'risk']",Web Resource,Web Page

Thus, PGMshave altered national- level decision- making by lowering the political thresholdfor the use of force and by slowing the likely loss of public support during a sustainedmilitary campaign. PGMs have also increased the tactical effectiveness ofmilitary operations. They have dramatically improved force exchange ratios (atleast against an adversary without these weapons) by reducing the likely numberof weapons required to destroy individual targets. In doing so, they haveeased logistical requirements and increased the pace at which military operationscan be conducted.","['Cyber Education Hub->Defense And Security Concepts->Tech Maintenance Tools And Techniques', 'Cyber Education Hub->Law And Doctrine->Law']","['conflict', 'cyber weapons', 'warfare']",Web Resource,PDF

opportunity to deploy an Enterprise Cloud Environment aligned with Federal Department-wide
Information Technology (IT) strategies and efficiency initiatives. Cloud computing enables the
Department to consolidate infrastructure, leverage commodity IT functions, and eliminate
functional redundancies while improving continuity of operations. The overall success of these
initiatives depends upon well executed security requirements, defined and understood by both
DoD Components and industry. Consistent implementation and operation of these requirements
assures mission execution, provides sensitive data protection, increases mission effectiveness,
and ultimately results in the outcomes and operational efficiencies the DoD seeks.
The 15 December 2014 DoD CIO memo regarding Updated Guidance on the Acquisition and
Use of Commercial Cloud Computing Services defines DoD Component responsibilities when
acquiring commercial cloud services. The memo allows components to responsibly acquire
cloud services minimally in accordance with the security requirements outlined in Federal Risk
and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) and this Cloud Computing Security
Requirements Guide (CC SRG). Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) previously
published the concepts for operating in the commercial cloud in the Cloud Security Model.
Version 1 defined the overall framework and provided initial guidance for public data. Version
2.1 added information for Controlled Unclassified Information. The CC SRG documents cloud
security requirements in a construct similar to other SRGs published by DISA for the DoD. This
SRG incorporates, supersedes, and rescinds the previously published Cloud Security Model
(CSM).","['Cloud Computing', 'Technology Stacks And Vulnerabilities', 'Defense Activities', 'Defense And Security Concepts']","['requirements', 'security', 'cloud', 'disa']",Web Resource,PDF

This talk deals with getting the most out of the computing resources you do have when cracking passwords.Our group at Florida State University is currently working on password cracking research to aid in forensics analysis. We've analyzed disclosed password lists to try and figure out how real people actually create passwords. Not all of these lists have been in plain text so we've had to go through the pain of cracking passwords ourselves. Just like you, we are still waiting on funding for that supercomputer as well. In this talk, we'll go over some of the tools and techniques we've used to crack these password lists using only a couple of PCs, such as custom wordlist generation and choosing the right word mangling rules. We'll also talk about some of the lessons we've learned and the mistakes we've made along the way.",['Cyber Education Hub->Attack And Exploit Concepts'],[],Web Resource,YouTube

From the stategovernment information technology leaders� perspective, cybersecurity has been onthe annual State CIO Top Ten priorities published by NASCIO since the inception of thelist in 2006. Since that first Top Ten List was published, the frequency, magnitude andsophistication of cyber attacks has continued to increase at an accelerated pace. Possiblybeyond what anyone could have imagined even ten years ago. Cybersecurity events nowhave the potential to significantly disrupt the business of government. The purpose of the guide is to encourage states to develop their owncyber disruption response plans. It provides guidance on what a cyberdisruption is and how states should proceed in developing capabilities toplan for, prevent, mitigate and respond to such events. It makes severalvery strong points:� State governments and the critical infrastructure within the stateare at risk from a cybersecurity attack that could disrupt thenormal operations of government and impact citizens.� Cyber disruption response planning is essential. It is one of thoseaspects of government that fit in the category, �ignore at yourown peril.�� Those working in this area must understand and appreciate theultimate effects of a cyber disruption are felt by individuals,families and communities whose lives are changed. Returning tonormalcy may never happen, or it may happen after much timeand effort. Thus, preparing for such events must be a priority forstate government, leaders and critical stakeholders.� Governance must be in place to start and guide the process ofdeveloping capabilities related to cyber disruption response.� Just like planning for a natural disaster, coordination andintegration among state government agencies and officials isessential.� Risk management, communications and training are high prioritiesfor cyber disruption response planning.� There exists either formally or informally a portfolio of threats.Those threats will move up or down the scale of threat levelsthroughout their lifecycle. It is conceivable that emergencymanagement and cyber security functions are tracking andmapping the same event.

In 2017, Netflix is recognized as one of the industry leaders at building and operating “cloud native” systems at scale. Like many organizations, Netflix has unique security requirements for many of their workloads. This variety requires a holistic approach to authorization to address “who can do what” across a range of resources, enforcement points, and execution environments.

In this talk, Manish Mehta (Senior Security Software Engineer at Netflix) and Torin Sandall (Technical Lead of the Open Policy Agent project) will present how Netflix is solving authorization across the stack in cloud native environments. The presentation shows how Netflix enforces authorization decisions at scale across various kinds of resources (e.g., HTTP APIs, gRPC methods, SSH), enforcement points (e.g., microservices, proxies, host-level daemons), and execution environments (e.g., VMs, containers) without introducing unreasonable latency. The presentation includes a deep dive into the architecture of the cloud native authorization system at Netflix as well as how authorization decisions can be offloaded to an open source, general-purpose policy engine (Open Policy Agent).

This talk is targeted at engineers building and operating cloud native systems who are interested in security and authorization. The audience can expect to take away fresh ideas about how to enforce fine-grained authorization policies across stack the cloud environment.",['DevSecOps Hub->USAF Organizations->Platform One'],"['service mesh', 'netflix']",Web Resource,YouTube

In the most recent legislation authorizing the activities of the Department of Defense, Congress was particularly proactive in its approach to military cyber operations. Provisions of the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), recently signed into law, will affect how the military organizes for and conducts cyber operations, in ways large and small.

Currently, little overlap exists between the two, although that might change in the aftermath of an extensive, destructive cyberattack. The most effective way to protect the cyber-dependent infrastructure is a comprehensive defense (deterrence by denial), which was impractical in the nuclear regime. However, this approach presents challenges. Existing legal norms, particularly those related to controlling collateral damage, might provide some deterrence.

Over the years, many Kaizen improvement activities have been carried out in the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). Since the F-15 (JASDF’s main fighter) was introduced more than 30 years ago, many Kaizen activities have involved maintenance and repair. Recent changes in environment and limited budget have made it more difficult to keep enough of these fighters operational and led to even more Kaizens. When the JASDF Kaizen team came across TOC, they initially didn’t quite get it. However, as the team began to understand and apply TOC, they saw a dramatic reduction to the regular inspection period within a surprisingly short time. As a result, Colonel Igarashi started to propel TOC under the name Project 10B. In this session, Colonel Igarashi will introduce the dramatic Project 10B application and discuss how it worked, how they achieved remarkable results, and how they are going forward without increasing the budget or human resources.",['Aircraft Maintenance->Officer Competency-Based Learning (CBL)->Communication'],"['toc', 'toc', 'theory of constraints', 'jasdf']",File,Video

To heal conflict, he says, look for the “transcendent unity” that will help you go beyond your core identity and connect with the other person. Shapiro advises that instead of dealing with the surface topic of the dispute, like finances or politics, look at the part that identity plays. If you feel that a dispute threatens your identity, you may think fighting is your only alternative. Your opponent may feel that way, too. But, Shapiro insists, you both have productive alternatives.

Lunches of Wisdom Background:
As most of you may be hearing, CANOPY has kick-started a Schoolhouse Initiative, called Lunches of Wisdom.  These are bi-monthly events, initially intended to host external entities as a ‘Vendor Corner’ (i.e. AWS, Oracle, Red Hat, etc) providing resources to inspire dialogue and spark innovative ideas across our Directorate.   

The ‘Vendor Corner’ is not intended to be representative of a catalogue within our purview, it is merely a no-cost offering to showcase tools and trades from various vendors we may or may not be currently working with. 

Lunches of Wisdom are for YOU, our teammates, to keep the tools sharp and also see other tools that may be in our kitbag.  That said, we in CANOPY will be hosting on MS Teams for FOUO/CUI purposes and will be recording the events in order to post them on our DI2E page for those of us who cannot attend and would like to view/reference later.

Lunches of Wisdom Background:
As most of you may be hearing, CANOPY has kick-started a Schoolhouse Initiative, called Lunches of Wisdom.  These are bi-monthly events, initially intended to host external entities as a ‘Vendor Corner’ (i.e. AWS, Oracle, Red Hat, etc) providing resources to inspire dialogue and spark innovative ideas across our Directorate.   

The ‘Vendor Corner’ is not intended to be representative of a catalogue within our purview, it is merely a no-cost offering to showcase tools and trades from various vendors we may or may not be currently working with. 

Lunches of Wisdom are for YOU, our teammates, to keep the tools sharp and also see other tools that may be in our kitbag.  That said, we in CANOPY will be hosting on MS Teams for FOUO/CUI purposes and will be recording the events in order to post them on our DI2E page for those of us who cannot attend and would like to view/reference later.

Psychology professor and negotiations expert Daniel Shapiro explains that  emotional conflicts threaten your identity, so that is where you must look to solve them. To heal conflict, he says, look for the “transcendent unity” that will help you go beyond your core identity and connect with the other person. Shapiro advises that instead of dealing with the surface topic of the dispute, like finances or politics, look at the part that identity plays. If you feel that a dispute threatens your identity, you may think fighting is your only alternative. Your opponent may feel that way, too. But, Shapiro insists, you both have productive alternatives.

The military deals with contractors on a daily basis and many computing systems we use, whether it be hardware or software, are provided by entities outside of the government through contracts. This new initiative would require contractors to adhere to a certain standard when it comes to the security of their products and would require them to monitor and report cyber incidents. I believe this new initiative will a good reinforcement tool for contractors to do their due diligence when developing and providing computing systems to the government. Many cyber attacks have been exaggerated because of companies' refusal to actively report cyber incidents within their systems. This dereliction of responsibility to monitor and report incidents within their own systems has already been extremely harmful to national security. Under this new initiative, these harmful practices by contractors would be penalized because the government would be able to go after them under the False Claims Act (FCA). If providing computing systems to the government, there should be some level of responsibility and accountability to effectively manage and report the vulnerabilities within one's systems.

5e45696f-34d1-41ce-af36-511ba682100d.json,"SolarWinds Shares More Information on Cyberattack Impact, Initial Access Vector","The SolarWinds hack in 2020 was a large-scale and sophisticated supply-chain attack on SolarWinds, a software company that services numerous companies and organizations, including the U.S. Government. The hackers gained access to the SolarWinds Orion platform, which provided IT and networking tools to customers, and used their update servers to push out a malware called SunBurst. The malware, also known as a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), gave hackers backdoor access to client systems and data. It went undetected for months because the malware was packaged with a legitimate update, that was signed off by SolarWinds. Up to 18,000 SolarWinds customers downloaded the malware but only a small subset were targeted. The hackers, believed to be associated with Russian Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) and intelligence groups, targeted specific high-value targets (HVTs) such as the Department of Justice, the Nuclear Weapons Agency, the Treasury,  the Department of Homeland Security, the Pentagon, and civilian companies such as Malwarebytes and Microsoft. 

This highlights one of cyber's most prevalent issues today. Attribution is tricky and even if cyber attacks can be traced back to individual hackers or groups, it is difficult to prove that their efforts are sanctioned by a nation-state. Although the SolarWinds hack was a cyber attack, it was non-kinetic and was unlikely to move armies and cause a war over espionage/intelligence efforts. That begs the question: ​will cyber ever lead to a real war or is war in cyberspace the real war?","['Cyber Education Hub->Actors And Agendas->Advanced Persistent Threats', 'Cyber Education Hub->Attack And Exploit Concepts', 'Cyber Education Hub->Actors And Agendas->Criminals', 'Cyber Education Hub->Law And Doctrine->Law', 'Cyber Education Hub->Technology Stacks And Vulnerabilities']",[],Web Resource,Web Page

a7c800df-8521-4817-a561-73bfbaa61ce1.json,What Drove Air Force Software Chief Chaillan to Quit,"This article goes over some of the highlights and reasonings as to why the first ever Air Force Chief Software Officer Nicolas M. Chaillan resigned on 02 September 2021. Chaillan had several large accomplishments during his time as the Air Force CSO. Some of these accomplishments included implementing Platform One under his DevSecOps initiative, new acquisition agreements, and implementing Kubernetes and containerization across several legacy weapons platforms. Despite his successes, he did encounter several roadblocks which certainly have potential to impact the DoD in a negative way. Some of these roadblocks included not having technically oriented leaders on technical projects, failure in advocation and understanding for the need to invest in technology, and the concern that each service is following their own software development track to support their respective “thirst for power” rather than the DoD coming together as a cohesive unit. I think of the DoD as a long-linked chain where each individual link represents a component or a resource of the DoD. Software development and the accompanying technology is one of those chains. If we aren’t on the same page across the DoD on the importance and impact the link has then the link is broken, which in turn breaks the whole chain. A broken chain leads to an unsecure door our adversaries are sure to take advantage of. We can not expect to fight as a cohesive unit if we have so many varying views on the importance and impact software development and technology have on the DoD.","['DevSecOps Hub->USAF Organizations', 'Avolve Hub->Contributing Content', 'Cyber Education Hub->Leadership Perspectives']",[],Web Resource,Web Page

985a0a9a-e654-4f57-98cd-eaaf427cc690.json,Inclusive Adult Learning Environments. ERIC Digest No. 162.,"Adult educators are recognizing that factors in the learning environment related to psychological, social, and cultural conditions exert a powerful influence on learners' growth and development. Current discussions on learning environments have broadened to include the need to confront issues of sexism and racism, interlocking systems of power and oppression, and social justice. In creating an inclusive learning environment, addressing institutional and societal levels is important, but the most significant level is the selection of appropriate materials and methods that address the characteristics of learning group members. Working toward the goal of creating an inclusive learning environment may give rise to some issues, especially those related to power and control. At the most basic level are the traditional power relations that exist between learners and teachers. The need to maintain a balance between being learner centered and learner positive can also be an issue. Suggestions to guide the development of inclusive learning environments include the following: acknowledge that all individuals bring multiple perspectives to any learning situation; recognize that a learner's claimed identity will be in response to many contextual factors that position the individual politically; reflect and value the experiences of learners; pay attention to power relations inherent in knowledge production; and acknowledge the power disparity between the teacher/facilitator and students.

A leader needs the guts to stand alone and look ridiculous. But what he's doing is so simple, it's almost instructional. This is key. You must be easy to follow!

Now comes the first follower with a crucial role: he publicly shows everyone how to follow. Notice the leader embraces him as an equal, so it's not about the leader anymore - it's about them, plural. Notice he's calling to his friends to join in. It takes guts to be a first follower! You stand out and brave ridicule, yourself. Being a first follower is an under-appreciated form of leadership.

Airmen,

Like many of you, I spend every day learning.  As a leader, I am still learning, even as your 22nd Chief of Staff.  I listen to podcasts and constantly read about leadership – I hope you do as well.  The Leadership Library is not static and will have periodic additions as I come across media and ideas I’d like to share to generate dialogue.  My aim is that this Leadership Library sparks conversations for you with fellow Airmen, with your family, and with your friends.

Part of the reason the United States Air Force is the best in the world is our thirst for knowledge and the way we challenge and question the status quo – no matter what package it comes in.  President Kennedy once said, “Leadership and learning are indispensable from each other.”  Think deeply about the ideas presented in this Leadership Library, challenge preconceived notions, and find ways to build a better Air Force for today’s Airmen and for those who will follow us.  As always, I’m proud to serve alongside you.
Sincerely,

Gen Charles Q. Brown, Jr.

Great patient populations! Our patients include active duty members, their families, as well as retired military members and their families.
The ability to provide total care. One of the fundamental advantages of the military health system is the ability to render care to a patient without worrying about whether or not they can afford to fill their prescriptions or obtain a vital lab test.
Quality colleagues. No doubt about it, physicians who choose to serve in the military are a special group of highly trained, dedicated professionals.
Travel opportunities. Air Force physicians can be stationed at military clinics and hospitals all over the world and deploy in support of military operations. In addition, they also participate in a variety of humanitarian missions and specialized medical training all over the globe.
Potential for zero debt and better pay! Not only does a HPSP scholarship cover all tuition, books, fees, it also provides a generous monthly stipend. Once doctors graduate from medical school, they will find that the salaries and benefits of being a military resident or fellow in a military training program far exceed civilian averages.
Opportunity to be a leader and make a difference. Not only for individuals in your own community, but quite possibly for individuals and communities around the world.","['Recruiter Hub->Lead Generation', 'Recruiter Hub->General']",[],Web Resource,YouTube

OSS is software for which the humanreadable source code is available for use, study, re-use, modification, enhancement, and redistribution by the users of such software. There are millions of publicly-available OSS components, libraries, and applications capable of accelerat;ng software modernization activities.

The Department's 2018 Cyber Strategy directed the Department to increase the use of secure OSS and to use commercial off-the-shelf tools when possible. The Department's forthcoming Software Modernization Strategy centers on the delivery of resilient software capability at the speed of relevance. OSS forms the bedrock of the software-defined world and is critical in delivering software faster. The Department must clearly articulate how, where, and when it participates, contributes, and interacts with the broader OSS community.","['Acquisition Hub->Program Management->Business Architecture->Software Acquisition', 'DevSecOps Hub->Security', 'Cyber Education Hub']",[],File,PDF

Said another way, looking at the trends independently causes concern. Looking at them holistically through an enterprise lens, how they feed one another, and how risk is compounded as one exams the interrelationships, raises the specter of creating profound near-term readiness risk, longer-term structural risk due to impacts to foundational sustainment capabilities that take years to recover, and ultimately impede our ability to transform into the Air Force We Need, faster.","['Aircraft Maintenance', 'Munitions and Missile Maintenance Hub', 'Logistics Readiness Hub']","['weapon system', 'sustainment']",File,PDF

Emerging technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and reverse engineering are paving the way for an increasingly complex security environment. A core tenant of winning in this new era of warfare is related to how we educate and train our military force. Many of the online trainings made available to servicemembers today fall short in their implementation of existing learning theories. This research identifies a gap in the current literature regarding common learning theories, noting that there is a lack of research regarding the implementation of active recall, spaced repetition, and elaboration into fully online and asynchronous learning paths. A workshop and an associated learning path (LP) were developed that implemented and tested the effects of these three learning theories. The results from the final assessment and pre and post-workshop surveys showed a positive benefit for competence and confidence with presented material within the LP, but more research is necessary to determine how these three theories affect motivation. This research surveyed the current literature regarding the topics at hand, produced a general framework for LP development, developed a LP for Agile software development (an emerging topic of interest for the DoD), and examined the effects of three forms of learning theory within an online and self-paced LP through a human-subjects research experiment.","['Avolve Hub->Learning Paths', 'DevSecOps Hub->Agile']",[],File,Video

b4a0a910-83dd-4c8d-9d14-7b82064b97a7.json,Fortyphid Simulation Training,"Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) have transformed the battlefield in recent years, with nearly every major operation now relying on them for reconnaissance or precision strikes. Moving pilots from the cockpits of traditional aircraft to remote UAS control centers came with the benefits of saving lives and money, but at the cost of increasing the attack surface for electronic and cyber warfare. This makes UAS cyber resilience more important than ever. In this introductory course, learn common cyber vulnerabilities and resilience strategies with hands-on labs using a 3D simulated UAS. After launching attacks on UAS technologies like MIL-STD-1553 and MAVLink to cause the UAS to crash, learn how to harden and defend against those common attacks to improve UAS cyber resilience.

Each exercise consists of a narrative on the system, offensive attacks, and defensive countermeasures. You will have two-weeks to complete the training, which should take about five hours if you do it at one time.

Training is unit funded and on a first come, first serve basis.  Please send your request to: AFLCMC.CROWS.EDU@us.af.mil

Maj Gen George charged both these airmen with a very specific task for their EWI fellowship.  He said, ""if you come back from Delta and tell me we need predictive maintenance, I already know that...if you come back from Amazon and tell me we need robots, I already know that. What I'm interested in, is how these companies create a culture that helps these new, innovative concepts become a success. That's what I want you guys to figure out.""

The idea for this document is to be the reference for all students to see the content we are covering each day during the week in a themed and organized format. It should also be used for a doc long after we've finished the class to look back and find contact info or additional resources that will help you through the command job. This pamplet does adjust slightly for each class and keeps getting more fine tuned with each class iteration. 

We have amazing guest speakers like Lt Gen Berry, Lt Col Cornell Burgess, Chief Paul Hammer, the Tesseract Team, Maj Alex Pagano, Maj Aaron Green, Lt Col Kyle Bailey, and more! The topics we cover are how to lead fearlessly, manage risk, build a strong positive culture within your unit with psychological safety. We also explore areas like innovation, money, and dealing with situations that you may not have encountered before like dealing with death in your unit.

Executive summary from article below:

On Thursday, February 24th, 2022, a cyber attack rendered Viasat KA-SAT modems inoperable in Ukraine.

Spillover from this attack rendered 5,800 Enercon wind turbines in Germany unable to communicate for remote monitoring or control.

Viasat’s statement on Wednesday, March 30th, 2022 provides a somewhat plausible but incomplete description of the attack.

SentinelLabs researchers discovered new malware that we named ‘AcidRain’.

AcidRain is an ELF MIPS malware designed to wipe modems and routers.

We assess with medium-confidence that there are developmental similarities between AcidRain and a VPNFilter stage 3 destructive plugin. In 2018, the FBI and Department of Justice attributed the VPNFilter campaign to the Russian government

AcidRain is the 7th wiper malware associated with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Update: In a statement disseminated to journalists, Viasat confirmed the use of the AcidRain wiper in the February 24th attack against their modems.","['Attack Activities', 'Exploit Tools And Techniques', 'Attack And Exploit Concepts', 'Actors And Agendas', 'Cyber Education Hub']","['cyber', 'malware', 'acidrain', 'sentinelone', 'cybersecurity', 'ukraine', 'russia']",Web Resource,Web Page

1523579a-898c-4344-96d4-6b28f9adc4f3.json,"A new, remarkably sophisticated malware is attacking routers","This article describes a new malware called ZuoRAT that has been found infecting numerous small-office/home-office routers. This malware is considered to be unusually sophisticated as it uses SOHO routers to gain access to the LAN, and it uses HTTP and DNS hijacking to perform a MITM attack. The attackers use ZuoRAT to enumerate all devices on the network and they have also created two additional pieces of malware (CBeacon and GoBeacon) they use to infect connected devices.

This potentially affects the DoD as we have made a significant transition to home-office work environments. With this increase, threat actors have a new vector to potentially gain access to CUI information typed by users at home.

The article summarizes and expands upon a Microsoft report posted a week ago.  For a more comprehensive cover of the cyberwar you can read the Microsoft report at https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE50KOK.   It includes details on the major Russian cyber-attack launched the day before the invasion targeting the Viasat satellite communications network and attempting to use FoxBlade to erase data from government networks.  It also mentions cyber-attacks against NATO countries, tracks Russian propaganda usage in the US, and discusses the large number of thwarted attacks. 
Despite the title, many Russian cyberattacks were also successful.  Ukraine provides an example of how Russian cyber and information operations are used as a force multiplier for conventional military operations.

This video will introduce the topic of Government Reference Architecture, or shortened to GRA. The topics covered in the video will be: 1) what is government reference architecture; 2) what is the purpose of GRAs and what are their benefits; and 3) how would a program use a GRA during systems acquisition process.

What is not going to be discussed in this video is how to build a GRA and how do you use the library of GRAs to best suited for your program. More on the GRA library later, but future videos will cover these topics to provide the details needed to implement GRAs to make the best use of digital engineering.","['Engineering', 'Technical Processes', 'Acquisition Hub']","['digital engineering', 'government reference architecture', 'reference architecture', 'solution architecture', 'gra']",File,Video

dd28ac0e-ab4e-4877-b82d-38f4f552db4e.json,Upcoming: Aircraft Maintenance Leadership Summit 12-14 October,"Your HAF/A4LM Aircraft Maintenance Division invites you to attend the second annual Aircraft Maintenance Leadership Summit, the first time held in-person. The summit will be hosted at AFIT, 12-14 October at Wright Patterson AFB. The 11th and the afternoon of the 14th will be travel days with the summit ending no later than 1200 on the 14th. This will be a unit-funded TDY. This is an event to bring the Headquarters Maintenance team together with our maintenance leaders from around the globe. If you cannot attend there will be a Zoom option. The target audience is Squadron level leadership teams and above. If your units can support additional officers and superintendent level leaders, we will welcome them to join until seats fill. This is an enterprise-wide summit, not to be confused with the 21A/M Squadron Commander Seminar in August. There will be an additional invite in the weeks to come including RSVP instructions, lodging, etc.

Current DDS security options increase system latency and decrease throughput by varying amounts. Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) encryption is a quicker method of encryption as compared to Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption which is a commonly used way to secure DDS implementations. LFSR encryption can be made secure by modern encryption standards and be implemented in both software and hardware. We suggest using the LFSR method of Alternating Step Generators (ASG) to provide for encryption security against modern attacks. In this paper, we propose a new decentralized way of securing DDS implementations by using ASG LFSR encryption to reduce the impact in DDS performance caused by current AES based security options.","['Defense And Security Concepts', 'Security Tools And Techniques']","['csce 525', '525', 'afit']",Web Resource,Web Page

Current DDS security options increase system latency and decrease throughput by varying amounts. Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) encryption is a quicker method of encryption as compared to Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption which is a commonly used way to secure DDS implementations. LFSR encryption can be made secure by modern encryption standards and be implemented in both software and hardware. We suggest using the LFSR method of Alternating Step Generators (ASG) to provide for encryption security against modern attacks.

The Iranian government seems to be severely limiting its citizens' internet access to media and communication sources as a way to limit both the flow of information out of Iran to the rest of the world for judgement, as well as block fact based information and criticism from coming into Iran. The DOD has a vested interest in this problem because Iran is just one of a number of authoritarian states implementing similar tactics to limit its citizens' access to information. Lessons learned in Iran could lead to the future liberation of this information and could serve DOD interests by creating internal opposition during conflicts with these states. Additionally, the idea of free information is an American ideal that our government will always have an interest in preserving globally and the DOD is one possible instrument in ensuring the survival of that freedom worldwide.

       This article focuses on why women tend to avoid STEM fields including cybersecurity, how to bring them into the field, and how to empower more women to stay in cyber career fields. The article is mainly referring to women in the cyber security field as a whole, not specifically department of defense (DoD) cyber security jobs, but the points of the article can be directly translated to the militaries need for increased diversity in the field. For instance, by noting that 8.3% of the Cyberwarfare career field in the US Air Force is women, it becomes evident that the DoD also parallels the diversity issues of cyber career fields in the civilian sector, (Warner). By acknowledging that cyber security lacks participation of women in both the military and civilian spheres, the need to address the issue in order to strength security in the cyber domain becomes clear.

Finances can be a vulnerability for military members, and if assets are captured by hackers, if may cause stress and adverse affects in the ability for individuals to perform at a high level for their jobs. 

On the cyber aspect, the bridges for crypto to be exchanged are extremely complex, which gives hackers many potential entry points. Similarly, the Air Force's infrastructure with managing its people and missions is also extremely complex. The approx 1.3 million members of the DoD gives adversaries many potential points of entrance whether that is through social engineering of stealing of credentials. The perceived security in being the ""largest exchange"" does not mean the organization is impervious to a hack - members of the DoD must also remain vigilant as many tout the US to have the arguably strongest military in the world.

8c8c9633-80c1-49ac-96ba-271ddcff9dd3.json,Facebook Detects 400 Android and iOS Apps Stealing Users Log-in Credentials,"This article discusses the discovery of over 400 apps designed to steal user Facebook credentials. This is concerning to the DoD for two main reasons: the tactics used to disguise the attacks and the scale of operations required to generate such an attack. 
	The malicious apps used in this attack were just not simple games or widgets designed to target a young, naïve demographic. Roughly 15% were business utilities and 42% were photo editors, which are apps that adults (e.g., DoD employees) might reasonably use. Additionally, 11% were disguised as VPNs, so even those who were security conscious could have fallen into the trap. Since the malicious apps all presented legitimate functions, it is hard to discern them from benign apps.
	The second factor is the scale of these attacks. It usually takes a team of people to develop one app, let alone over 400. Additionally, these apps vary widely in purpose and design, creating an even larger workload. The creator of these apps also flooded the app store with fake positive reviews to further bolster the scam against discovery. This is not the case of one person in their mom’s basement trying to steal data for fun. 
	This attack is a threat to the DoD because it targets the most valuable component of the force: people. Attackers could turn on location services of DoD personnel, use their personal data for other social engineering or spear phishing attacks, or even create messages or post seemingly coming from DoD members that discredit or disrupt US military operations. This attack doesn’t just threaten the DoD members vulnerable to having their data stolen, but also their friends and family. Attackers with access to family members’ accounts could attempt to use it to weaken morale or distract from the mission. 
	While Facebook has removed these apps from the app store, there are undoubtedly more just like them that are currently undetected and many more that will be created in the future. DoD members must remain cautious with their own cybersecurity an ensure that their loved ones do the same.

0464bfd3-77a6-4854-bf09-207deb445efd.json,COG PACK™  EYE/HEAD/GAZE/HEATMAP  3D DISPLAY DOCUMENTATION,"Viewing physiological signals can take many forms. Historically, electro-mechanical devices contained the elements required to display the waveforms. These devices used mechanically driven rolls of paper tape with pens to transcribe the waveforms of interest over time. A modern example that may be familiar to many is the polygraph machine. A polygraph machine typically displays blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration, and skin conductivity to the examiner. From these waveforms, the examiner then determines the validity of a test subject's statements. 
Given the new emphasis on digital technologies and the rise of software-based solutions, many physiological devices still present the waveform data to a user as a strip-chart. These strip-charts are useful for many physiological data types, but not all. In some circumstances, 3D models may provide greater insight. For Eye, Head, and Gaze-based data-types, as well as a few additional derived types, creating and displaying a 3D world model may afford a more comprehensive view of a participant's interaction with task elements. Additionally, when presenting data in real-time from more open ended experimental design constructs, further consideration in the presentation of these data can be constructed. This document discusses the approach taken in COG Pack™ to not only display those data-types but permits many additional controls and adjustments.

f107f6d5-95fc-48d4-b116-0c649796a1ff.json,COG Pack™ Technical Design Document,"Many of the most popular hardware and software products for measuring and improving human performance are developed and marketed for standalone use. For research and development or operational use, more effective insights into human performance may be obtained by leveraging diverse measurements from multiple sensors. Often the devices lack the ability to interoperate and the extensibility to do varies across devices. As a result, developers supporting human performance research and interested in utilizing a promising new device must generate a new set of requirements and sensor-specific code to integrate the device before researchers can begin the collection of physiological and performance-based data. In the current human performance assessment space there are few coherent software architecture or data formats that can be shared effectively among research groups, leaving groups to sit on an island unable to communicate effectively or integrate established and emerging technologies. 
Cognitive Operations Gear (COG) Pack™ serves as a domain-flexible software architecture designed to collect and analyze human physiological and behavioral data with the end goal of providing operator state assessment. COG Pack currently supports a wide selection of hardware devices. Smart Eye Pro for eye tracking and wearables like Zephyr BioHarness for cardiorespiratory and activity measurement, to name a few. The underlying software architecture offers unique insights into (I) developing (Dukes, et al., 2019), (II) integrating, and (III) maintaining new hardware and software.

68100f80-844e-4df5-920a-df64b4f74a97.json,COG Pack™ UI Manual,"  The design of the COG Pack Dashboard allows a user to set up, configure, and manage multiple Sensors by providing a standard look and feel for each Sensor. Generally, when manufacturers develop hardware sensors, they provide a custom application designed to only work with their particular device. From an integration standpoint, this provides a high barrier of entry for researchers and users when an experiment requires multiple disparate sensors. Each independent application often provides unique functionality for actions such as saving files, managing sensor state connectivity, and observing the data-streams in real-time. One of the objectives of the COG Pack Dashboard is to simplify these steps and consolidate them into a single interface. Additionally, by leveraging a database back-end for data storage, COG Pack automatically manages data timestamps and organization. By not requiring a user to execute multiple mouse actions and keyboard inputs for file management, COG Pack streamlines this process and reduces the potential for ‘fat-fingered’ input errors.
  The goal of this document is to provide a user or researcher with the instructions they need to work with the COG Pack Dashboard. This document contains descriptions of the processes and procedures required to interact with the supported Sensors and Signals.

Risk Management is a tool that helps organizational leaders allocate scarce resources (time, talent, money, etc.) to proactively minimize failure of organizational goals and objectives. Or, in a more positive light, RM helps proactively enhance success of organizational goals and objectives. This presumes organizational members know the goals and objectives - a condition we at AFIT often find lacking with students. In this time before the class, please use the attached job aid to help define the goals and objectives for your unique organization. Knowing these in advance of class will make the class much more meaningful and will help you both, student and supervisor, apply the concepts we teach to benefit your organization immediately.","['Organizational Project Enabling Processes', 'Technical Management Processes', 'Engineering', 'Program Management', 'Logistics', 'Plan for Support', 'Project Risk Management', 'Technical', 'Project Cost Management', 'Project Schedule Management', 'Project Scope Management', 'Project Systems Engineering Management', 'Technology Development and Risk Reduction', 'Supply Chain Management', 'Technical Data Management / Technical Orders', 'Sustaining / Systems Engineering']","['organizational objectives', 'risk management', 'life cycle risk management', 'inputs, processes, outputs (ipo)', 'risk', 'objectives', 'goals', 'sys 208', 'sys 118', 'acquisition', 'program management', 'project management', 'project risk management', 'systems engineering', 'risk reduction']",File,Video

I deftly describe how it helps us understand the design process. I also introduce a few other complexity-navigating methods and the key components that make them capable of dealing with a dynamic and largely unknowable domain.

The impact of overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning our next vacation―each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions.

Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives―and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.

This article highlights how Ukraine has been able to target Russian troops using open-source social media data and phone signals. This intelligence has also led to one of the deadliest Russian losses in the conflict. Despite this, and that Russian leaders have been instituting a cell phone ban, Russian troops are still using their cell phones which are giving away their locations. The U.S. is not immune to this, as in 2018, fitness tracking data gave away base locations and troop movements (1). Both examples show that cyber security will be a huge factor in future conflicts beyond the military context and into the personal realm. Moreover, how militaries respond to this could have life-and-death impacts.

the number of available devices, a new set of challenges arise within the software development

performance are limited in the available solutions. Many steps are required to complete the analysis
process. Digitizing the analog signal, aggregating the signals from multiple devices and multiple
Airmen, and sending the signals to intelligent algorithms distributed across a network of computers
are just a few. However, before implementing a solution, many details should be considered. These

a4eda706-156e-424c-95bd-a258754b9d87.json,Contract AI Risk Engine (CARE) to Reduce Cyber Contracting Risk,"This article in the Army's Cyber Defense Review outlines a proposal for a new program called Contract AI Risk Engine, or CARE, to assist with reducing the U.S. Government's potential risk regarding cyber and IT contracts. The first part of the article describes some of the areas of risk related to cyber and IT contracts and why those risks exist with the remainder of the article outlining the proposal for using AI/ML to help reduce this risk in the future. In summary, the intent is to analyze a collection of existing contracts for areas of risk as well as methods for risk mitigation, categorize those areas into features, and build a model for producing risk scores to contract management personnel and commanders. The intended use case is that draft contract proposals will be submitted to the CARE system and receive a risk score. If the score falls under the set level of risk tolerance then the contract moves forward, or if the score is above the level of tolerance then the draft is updated based on recommended changes or requires commander approval to accept the risk. This is relevant to several current topics in DoD acquisition. For one, leaders understand that not all personnel can be cyber experts but do need a base level of cybersecurity understanding - this tool could not only help raise that level of understanding through use but could also reduce the level of operational risk while that learning is occurring. Additionally, if this product were used in conjunction with new technologies in system development/lifecycle management (i.e., digital engineering and DevSecOps) then the implementation of this tool could be automated within the orchestration of the development/management processes. One final thought is that this is yet another proposed mechanism for defining a method for risk quantification. In many areas of acquisition, to include cybersecurity, the DoD is realizing the need to quantifiably measure risk and define acceptable levels; this provides one potential method for such quantification of risk within cyber and IT contracts.

While the directive only directs guidance for the acquisition of these weapons systems, it does uncover that action must be taken. Some questions immediately come to my mind when I think about this: Where is the data to build these algorithms coming from? Should there be ethical checks on the data and system? Should there be requirements for explainable AI over not-explainable AI? 

The answer to these questions could fill a dissertation, but they are all necessary to address. Guidelines behind explainable AI are critical to the force. Certain problems can be thrown into a black box, and correct answers can spit out. But, when we deal with people and money, the DoD will likely need to have explanations behind AI outcomes. This will require more expensive AI research and software development, but one that I think might be necessary for our line of work that might not be needed in the civilian world.

In its current definition, CMMC is a Cybersecurity maturuity model conducted by  third party agencies in which, contractors must meet a minimum threshold requirement to respond to Request for Proposals. CMMC would apply five levels of NIST certification standards to contractors that must be met in order to be a prime or subcontractor. To get this initiative started, the CMMC Accreditation Body indicates that there will need to be 10,000 licensed assessors in order to assess 350,000 firms. 
Kendall believes that intent was noble for this effort, however, since the government doest not determine compliance, he foresees many issues down the road with the creation of a new bureacracies, outside of governmental bounds. Assessors will possess the ability to tell contractors that they are not allowed to bid on contracts and this could potentially create mischief and massive disputes. Who then bears the risk?

f76c35d2-7f12-4cb6-8f2f-f2f7db3ef54e.json,(Prepublication) Deep-Layer Training of CNN for SAR with Two-Stage Data Augmentation,"(Prepublication of RADAR2023-8308)

Abstract— This study [from the Naval Postgraduate School] explores a novel two-stage data augmentation technique to expand the training capacity of the small synthetic SAMPLE dataset through the mechanism of deep layer training. Ultimately, the present investigation seeks to improve the classification performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) when trained on synthetic SAMPLE data and tested against measured SAR imagery. One possible explanation for the non-optimal performance of CNN in such scenarios is detectable high-level differences between synthetic and measured SAR imagery. When fine detail information is removed from synthetic datasets, the augmented data can train deep layers more readily. By also changing background texture, overfitting is reduced. Combined, these augmentations improve a CNN’s effectiveness at classifying measured data. To achieve this two-stage augmentation, a combination of kernel operations, threshold-based segmentation, and alpha blending are used. Comparative evaluations using transfer learning and multiresolution datasets are performed with the five-layer AConvNet CNN. Both test accuracy and training activity are evaluated to provide qualitative evidence of deep layer training. Improved accuracy in these experiments provides quantitative evidence that this two-stage data augmentation can effectively improve the training capacity of synthetic SAR imagery.","['Develop AI', 'Employ AI', 'AI Researcher', 'Intel']","['deep layer training', 'cnn', 'sar atr', 'alpha blending', 'aconvnet', 'sample', 'mstar', 'ai/ml']",File,PDF

His career in intelligence began as a Naval Intelligence Officer in an operational intelligence center focused on support to critical operational naval missions. He would later serve joint intelligence missions in Europe, would rise to lead all analytical activities at the Defense Intelligence Agency and in DoD Combatant Commands, and would later serve as the Chairman of the famed National Intelligence Council (NIC). Also served as a senior leader at ODNI, including leading the entire intelligence community as the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence from May 13, 2020 until February 2021.

In this OODAcast we learn some of what made Neil tick, diving into his education, his early career intent, the role of serendipity in helping him transition to the intelligence community, and his approach to leadership and management. We also dive into big issues of optimizing intelligence including ways organizations can help guard against cognitive bias.

Neil provides insights into his approaches to:
– Training analytical methods and understanding which methods should be applied to which situations
– Ways to teach analysts to spot their own cognitive bias and seek to mitigate, and ways to use the benefits of teams to help spot and mitigate analytical flaws
– Ways to avoid deception by adversaries
– Methods that can improve mental models
– The mission of the National Intelligence Council and its key products, including those available to the public
– Ways to find balance between the need to serve policy makers and military leaders without being captured by and influenced in appropriately by them
– The role of the ODNI, what it is and what it should be
– The thesis that the US is about to enter and age of abundance and what this means for the US and the world

Software which is designed to randomly terminate instances so that engineers can plan for failures in the future and make their system more resilient. While Netlix’s Moneky has drastically evolved since its creation, the idea itself could easily be applied to cyber security and could be extremely beneficial. From a DoD perspective, this could simulate attacks on systems for us to see how current systems respond. But how? I would argue that there are numerous ways that this could be applied. For example, we could employ bugs and viruses that are created and safe. Almost like a red-team. Or, follow more similar to Netflix and provide outages to critical systems to see how operations would be impact, and how to mitigate these impacts in the future.

For example, hypothesis #2 states that ""M&S offers the best tool to evaluate the impact of cyber threats and system weaknesses"" and the discussion of this hypothesis references the physical, logical, and social layers of cybersecurity. This paper can be valuable to the DoD in that the discussion of the hypotheses helps the reader understand the applicability and usefulness of modeling in the cybersecurity discipline. These hypotheses may serve as a good resource for starting the cybersecurity modeling discussions within a SPO/PMO.

It takes practice and iteration to continuously implement the five focusing steps. FE Warren has refined their implementation of Theory of Constraints, and because of that, the case study has been updated. We aim to make these case studies livable documents that change and grow as the initiative matures/sustains.

We are excited to share a #TOC case study showcasing the progress and efforts of utilizing the Theory of Constraints of the 90 MW at FE Warren AFB!

In 2021, the 90 MXG evaluated their site dispatch scheduling process and applied full kitting and buffer management to their maintenance location visits in the field. This enabled them to create stability and predictability in field operations while maintaining Wing level performance objectives.

We hope this case study offers valuable insights for organizations considering to apply Theory of Constraints in their own efforts. It demonstrates how anyone can use TOC for various scenarios and implement it in their operations.","['War Planning', 'Life Cycle Sustainment', 'Base-specific', 'Innovation', 'Tesseract', 'ICBM', 'Mission Execution', 'Managing Resources', 'Leading People', 'Improving the Unit', 'Communication']",[],File,PDF

3. Students have the flexibility to learn “anytime and anywhere,” meaning that student learning can take place outside of traditional classroom and school-based settings, such as through work-study programs or online courses, or during nontraditional times, such as on nights and weekends.

We have seen the most readiness gains with ToC initiatives when we optimize mission generation capacity as a whole system, particularly streamlining maintenance sortie generation capabilities while maximizing operations utilization capabilities. 

One of the first instances of a ToC initiative being conducted in Ops/Mx simultaneously was the efforts of the 552nd Air Control Wing (ACW) at Tinker AFB, and we are excited to share their #TOC case study with you!

In the beginning of fiscal year 2021, 552nd ACW was anticipating a very challenging year ahead due to a combination of one-time crew conversion, a growing student backlog, and the fleet undergoing modifications. Parallel ToC implementations in the Operation’s Group with the Maintenance Group, enabled the needle-moving readiness gains. 

By the end of April 21, the Operations Group increased crew readiness by 131% (from 356 ready crew to 823 ready crew) in 6 months and the Maintenance Group increased their daily flyable aircraft by 51%.

This is a presentation of the thesis written by Major Jason Lowery, an active-duty US Space Force astronautical engineer and US National Defense Fellow at MIT tasked with advising senior US military leaders about the national strategic implications of Bitcoin. In this thesis, Lowery presents a novel theory to the US Department of Defense that Bitcoin doesn't just represent a peer-to-peer cash system; it also (and more importantly) represents a new form of digital-age warfare that will transform national security, cyber security, and possibly even the base-layer architecture of the internet. Using scientific concepts from biology, evolution, anthropology, political science, and computer theory, Lowery summarizes the dynamics of power projection in human society and provides an argument for why emerging proof-of-work technologies (namely Bitcoin) will have a dramatic impact on how humans organize, cooperate, and compete on a global scale by empowering populations to project physical power in, from, and through cyberspace. Major Lowery concludes that Bitcoin represents a national strategic imperative that the US should support and adopt as quickly as possible, or else it risks losing its lead as a global superpower in the 21st century.","['Cloud Computing', 'Tech Maintenance Tools And Techniques', 'Security Tools And Techniques', 'Defense Activities', 'Tradecraft and Methods']",[],File,Video

Successful executives and professional people know the price of excellence is careful preparation. In anticipation of the big game, the coach spends hours planning the plays and watching the team execute them. Should we attempt such a complicated process as learning with less attention than is given to other important activities? The answer is obvious: of course not. The effective instructor devotes much time and energy in carefully planning and preparing each lesson, whether the lesson encompasses one or several periods of instruction.

2edb4003-1501-4a36-bad2-fe6e54a727f2.json,The Cyber Dimension of the Russia–Ukraine War,"This article titled 'The cyber dimension of the Russia-Ukraine war' has been extensively researched and discussed. When it comes to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, where cyber technology was utilized to counter the adversaries' advances, I believe that we can learn many lessons from the conflict as we look at how well-matched states can interact to create modern cyber conflicts. These characteristics can be leveraged by the Defense Department to ensure that we are able to utilize the war for the best possible outcome. In the online “information” war, a major component has been the massive online “information” war for hearts and minds, which has been amplified by private cyber vigilantes, as well as by several other actors. However, Ukrainian cyber security, supplemented by Western assistance, has been largely blunting the impact. In addition, the report also mentions that there is still the possibility that the cyber conflict could escalate beyond the boundaries of cyberspace into a wider conflict that could have a profound impact.  As mentioned in the article, there is a high probability that this will happen because there are no clear guidelines on what constitutes cyber operations, how they should be used responsibly, and how international law should apply to them. Therefore, there is a pressing need for states to address these issues as soon as possible.

Takeaways:  Nevertheless, there is still a risk that in the near future, the cyber conflict could escalate to a more generalized confrontation between Russia and NATO that extends beyond cyberspace.

83ec1882-9505-4ecb-a759-ef963f2acb45.json,Cyberattack knocks out satellite communications for Russian military,"A Washington Post article describing a cyber attack on Russian satellite systems.  Post-mutiny and Russian state/military impacts are discussed as a result of losing satellite communications for about a day. 

The claim that more than 2 groups had claimed credit for the hack suggests the possibility of Wager and additional supporting groups finding common ground in the close days following a failed coup attempt by Wagner.  It also brings up the potential of outside groups inserting misinformation or falsely crediting other actors in an attempt to sow confusion within internal Russian agencies and the government.  

The annual revenue of the satellite communication company being only $10 million USD seems small considering it supports such a large array of governmental and military defensive needs.  This small size and revenue stream might then feed into the western narrative of a corrupt, mismanaged, and outdated defensive capability.

Additionally, should the notion of cyber attacks with a low threat of reprisal be true and if Wager is truely behind it, future cyber attacks on Russian infrastructure should be expected.  Which (if any) targets are chosen in the future could help tease out if this is a purely Wagner-Russian conflict, or if additional local support or foreign actors are at play.","['Cyber Education Hub', 'Actors And Agendas', 'Hacktivists', 'Advanced Persistent Threats', 'Insider Threats']",[],Web Resource,Web Page

Therefore to mitigate these costs companies are starting to employ cyber security professionals to secure their networks and data with an expected 40% of C-suite’s having a cybersecurity committee by 2025. Securing America's companies from cyber threats falls within national security, the DoD along with NIST can provide leadership lessons to mitigate these threats.","['Cyber Education Hub', 'Policy And Strategy', 'Leadership Perspectives', 'Security', 'Leadership']",[],Web Resource,Web Page
